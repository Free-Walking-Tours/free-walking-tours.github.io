                <h1>Overview of Free Walking Tours</h1>
                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>
                    Our favorite way of quickly becoming familiar with a new city: Free Walking Tours!
                    These are tours, typically guided by locals, without a fixed price.
                    Instead you are free to tip what you think is appropriate after the tour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a problem with these tours these days.
                    Now there are many intermediate companies that advertise with free walking tours, but they don't
                    actually run anything.
                    Rather, they sell your enrollment to the real local guides, eating into their profits and
                    contributing nothing.
                    So this overview is made, to circumvent these resellers that are flooding your Google results.
                </p>

                <h2>Overview</h2>

                <p>
                    A much bigger collection of tours already exists at:
                    <a href="https://freetourcommunity.com/">freetourcommunity.com</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    That website should be used instead, this page will be archived.

                    This list is far from complete or from perfect.
